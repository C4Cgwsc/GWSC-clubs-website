Our platform of choice is the Lego Mindstorms Kit, however if you are proficient at other platforms, such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi, you may choose to do this. At each competition, the cohort gets more difficult, as you are required to place in the top 10 (unless there is low participation in the selected division) to qualify for the next competition. The primary division we offer is Rescue Line, where you must create a robot from scratch to navigate a course directed by a black line, ending with a rescue situation where you have to rescue the \\u201Cvictim\\u201D from a chemical spill. There are two sub-divisions you can take. The first is Secondary Rescue, which requires you to lock the \\u201Cvictim\\u201D in the robot\\u2019s grasp and push it out of the chemical spill, and Advanced Rescue, which is more suited for advanced/returning students involved in this competition. Advanced Rescue requires you to lift the \\u201Cvictim\\u201D up onto a singular platform. Aside from Rescue Line, there are other divisions. For extremely advanced students, we may offer you the opportunity to compete the Soccer division, which involves in getting two robots to simultaneously play soccer against two other robots. Another competition can also be introduced, if there are enough advanced and interested students in the yearly cohort. This competition is the First Lego League, which pushes the students minds to new limits, STEAM concepts being used all in one package. New mathematical and engineering concepts will be introduced via our club, and if you want a persuading item on your resume, be sure to join.\"]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName:
