# GWSC-clubs-website
This is the website for GWSC clubs, as the name would suggest. Live website link to be posted.

# How to install on your device
Install the latest version of node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Clone the repository in your desired folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/C4Cgwsc/GWSC-clubs-website
```

Navigate to the folder:
```
cd /path/to/GWSC-clubs-website
```

Run the website in the browser:
```
npm start
```

You should be able to see the website running. If may not load immediately.

# How to contribute
Follow the above steps on installation.

The main folder that has content is the source (src) folder. You can safely ignore all other folders.

I suggest using the Atom IDE for this project, as you can easily fetch and contribute remotely using their built-in git and Github tools.
